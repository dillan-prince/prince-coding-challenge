View the live app at https://prince-coding-challenge.herokuapp.com

The Heroku app runs off the code living at the GitHub repo dillan-prince/prince-coding-challenge, which should be identical to the code living at Popspots/prince-coding-challenge. The app deploys automatically through a GitHub webhook that listens for commits to the master branch. Heroku requires that a connected GitHub account in order to use GitHub webhooks, and I had to use my personal account since I don't have access to the Popspots account.
